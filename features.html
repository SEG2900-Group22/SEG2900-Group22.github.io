                        <h3>Viewing Party</h3>
                        <p>The main goal of this website is to give a platform to people that want to watch with friends and family together virtually. There are always circumstances that could cause people to not be able to meet up with friends to watch a match together or to go to actual live games. Solo has you covered for that. We have created a platform that allows people from anywhere be able to view with anyone and any popular sport with just the click of a button.</p>
